            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hailing from the vibrant city of Mangalore, I'm currently pursuing my final year of engineering at Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, Mangalore. Throughout my academic journey, I've honed my problem-solving abilities and developed a keen interest in technology. I'm keen on learning new things to continually upskill myself and have a natural ability to gel and coordinate with others.f engineering studies, I have a solid foundation in web development, and I'm open to exploring new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a deep passion for poetry writing. I've had the honor of winning prizes within my college for my poetic creations and even attended a district-level competition where I proudly secured a consolation prize. Poetry allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a unique and artistic way, and it's a hobby I hold dear.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                As I continue to grow and learn in the ever-evolving world of technologies, I look forward to taking on new challenges and creating meaningful online experiences that leave a positive impression on users. I'm also open to freelancing opportunities, and I'm excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.
